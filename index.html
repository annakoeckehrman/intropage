            <p>Pixels allow you to set the exact size of an element's box (width and height). When the width and height of an element are set in pixels, it will be the same size on all devices — an element that fills a laptop screen will overflow a mobile screen.</p>

            <p>The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding . Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it. In CSS, you can modify this space with the padding property.<br><br>If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box's content, you can use the following properties: padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-right, padding-left</p>
